# FP in Rust

Who am I?

What is Rust and why should you care?

- 'new' systems programming language
- fast, safe, concurrent

Is Rust functional?

- not per definition

BUT

FP is more than an adjective to describe a programming language

it's an adjective to describe a mental way of approaching programming

and it's a adjective to describe tool in our toolbox as programmers


SO, let's use our minds and tools and take a look what kind of FP we can find in Rust

---

immutability Y/N  (talk about borrow/ownership?)

functions Y

pure functions Y

higher order functions N

map, reduce, filter Y

ITERATORS

Recursion??

Closures?? Currying?

persistent data structures N

Lazy evaluation??

functional representation??

Rust is a relatively new systems programming language focused on performance and safety. Functional languages usually occupy the higher level language space, further away from the bare metal.
Yet some of Rust's features seem very much suited to program in a functional style.
Put your headlamps on, we have some exploring to do!
